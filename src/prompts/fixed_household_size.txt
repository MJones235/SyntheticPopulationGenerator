You are generating a realistic synthetic population for {LOCATION}.

The full population will consist of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} households. So far, {N_HOUSEHOLDS} have been generated. You will now generate one new household to add to this population.

The household should contain exactly {NUM_PEOPLE}.

  - `"Couple with dependent children"`

- `"gender"`: a string, either `"Male"` or `"Female"`  
- `"relationship_to_head"`: a string describing the person's relationship to the head of the household  
  - The first person listed is the head of the household and must have `"relationship_to_head": "Head"`.  The head should be an adult.  
  - Other valid values are: `"Partner"`, `"Child"`, `"Grandchild"`, `"Parent"`, `"Housemate"`, `"Other"`
