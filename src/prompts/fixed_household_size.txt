You are generating a realistic synthetic population for {LOCATION}.

The full population will consist of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} households. So far, {N_HOUSEHOLDS} have been generated. You will now generate one new household to add to this population.

Across the entire population, the distributions of age, gender and occupation should reflect those reported in the 2021 UK Census. 

The household should contain exactly {NUM_PEOPLE}.

{GUIDANCE}

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

{OCCUPATION_STATS}
