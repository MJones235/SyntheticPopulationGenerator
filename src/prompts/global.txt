You are generating a realistic synthetic population for {LOCATION}.

The full population will consist of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} households. So far, {N_HOUSEHOLDS} have been generated. You will now generate one new household to add to this population.

The household should contain {NUM_PEOPLE}.

{GUIDANCE}

--------------------------------

Individual-Level Context:

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

--------------------------------

Each individual within the household must be represented as an object with the following fields:

- `"age"`: an integer 
- `"gender"`: a string, either `"Male"` or `"Female"`  
- `"relationship_to_head"`: a string describing the person's relationship to the head of the household  
  - The first person listed is the head of the household and must have `"relationship_to_head": "Head"`.  The head should be an adult.  
  - Other valid values are: `"Spouse"`, `"Partner"`, `"Child"`, `"Parent"`, `"Sibling"`, `"Grandchild"`, `"Grandparent"`, `"Housemate"`, `"Lodger"`, `"Aunt"`, `"Uncle"`, `"Nephew"`, `"Niece"`, `"Cousin"`, `"Child-in-law"`, `"Parent-in-law"`, `"Sibling-in-law"`

Return a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "household": [
    {
      "age": ...,
      "gender": "...",
      "relationship_to_head": "...",
    }
  ]
}

Output only the JSON object â€” do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
