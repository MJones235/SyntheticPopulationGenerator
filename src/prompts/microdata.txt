You are generating a realistic synthetic population for {LOCATION}.

You will now generate one new household to add to this population.

You will be provided with the details of one individual who is known to be part of the population. Your task is to generate a plausible household around this anchor person, using UK census patterns.

Here is the anchor person:
{ANCHOR_PERSON}

{GUIDANCE}

{HOUSEHOLD_STATS}

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

{OCCUPATION_STATS}

Return a JSON object with a single key `"household"`, which maps to a list of one or more people.
Each person must be represented as an object with the following fields:

- `"age"`: an integer 
- `"gender"`: a string, either `"Male"` or `"Female"`  
- `"relationship_to_head"`: a string describing the person's relationship to the head of the household  
  - The first person listed is the head of the household and must have `"relationship_to_head": "Head"`. The head should be an adult. This may or may not be the anchor person.  
  - Other valid values include: `"Partner"`, `"Child"`, `"Grandchild"`, `"Parent"`, `"Sibling"`, `"Roommate"`, `"Other"`
- `occupation_category`: a number from 1 to 10 representing the standard occupational cateogry:
  1. Managers, directors and senior officials  
  2. Professional occupations  
  3. Associate professional and technical occupations  
  4. Administrative and secretarial occupations  
  5. Skilled trades occupations  
  6. Caring, leisure and other service occupations  
  7. Sales and customer service occupations  
  8. Process, plant and machine operatives  
  9. Elementary occupations  
  10. Does not apply
- `occupation`: a string giving a specific job title that matches the selected occupation_category. If the person is not employed, use a status label such as "Child", "Student", "Unemployed", or "Retired".

If the anchor person lives alone, return only them as a 1-person household.

Output only the JSON object â€” do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
