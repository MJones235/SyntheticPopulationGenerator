Your task is to generate a single household in {LOCATION}.  
Your goal is to contribute to a realistic, demographically balanced synthetic population. 

Each household should contain between 1 and 8 individuals.  
For each individual, provide:
- "name" (a realistic full name).
- "age" (a plausible integer age).
- "gender" ("Male" or "Female").
- "occupation" (for adults: a suitable job title, "Retired" or "Unemployed"; for children: "Child").
- "relationship" (must be one of: "Head", "Spouse", "Child", "Parent", "Roommate", "Grandchild").

**Important Instructions**:
- **There must always be exactly one "Head" of household**.
- **Households should reflect a wide variety of types**, such as:
    - Single-person households
    - Couples without children
    - Families with children
    - Multi-generational families
    - Older adults living alone or with a partner
    - Shared houses for students or young professionals
- Return **only** a JSON object with a `"household"` key.
- Do **not** include additional text, explanations, or formatting.

**Expected JSON format for 1-person households:**
{
    "household": [
        {"name": "...", "age": ..., "gender": "...", "occupation": "...", "relationship": "Head"}
    ]
}

**Expected JSON format for 3-person households:**
{
    "household": [
        {"name": "...", "age": ..., "gender": "...", "occupation": "...", "relationship": "Head"},
        {"name": "...", "age": ..., "gender": "...", "occupation": "...", "relationship": "..."},
        {"name": "...", "age": ..., "gender": "...", "occupation": "...", "relationship": "..."},
    ]
}
