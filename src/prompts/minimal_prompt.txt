Each household should contain between 1 and 6 individuals.  
For each individual, provide:
- "name" (a realistic name).

- "relationship" (must be one of: "Head", "Spouse", "Child", "Parent", "Sibling", "Roommate").

**Important Instructions**:
- **There must always be exactly one "Head" of household**.
- **Children must inherit the surname of one of their parents**.
- **Spouses may or may not share a surname with the Head**.
- **Roommates and unrelated household members may have different surnames**.
