Generate a household located in {city}.  

The household should contain between 1 and 6 individuals.  
For each individual provide:
- "name" (a realistic name)
- "age" (a plausible integer age)
- "occupation" (a suitable job title, "Student" for school-aged children, and "Infant" for babies who are too young for school)

Example:
[
    {
        "name": "name of first person",
        "age": "age of first person", 
        "occupation": "occupation of first person"
    },
    {
        ...
    }
]

Return only a valid JSON array, with no additional text or explanation.  Even if the household contains only one person, still return an array.
