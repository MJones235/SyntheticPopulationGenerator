You are generating a realistic synthetic population for {LOCATION}.

The full population will consist of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} households. So far, {N_HOUSEHOLDS} have been generated. You will now generate one new household to add to this population.

Across the entire population, the distributions of household size, age, and gender should reflect those reported in the 2021 UK Census. 

All major household types should be represented, including:
- Single-person
- Couples
- Families
- Houseshares

{GUIDANCE}

{HOUSEHOLD_STATS}

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

Return a JSON object with a single key `"household"`, which maps to a list of one or more people.
Each person must be represented as an object with the following fields:

- `"age"`: an integer 
- `"gender"`: a string, either `"Male"` or `"Female"`  
- `"relationship_to_head"`: a string describing the person's relationship to the head of the household  
  - The first person listed is the head of the household and must have `"relationship_to_head": "Head"`  
  - Other valid values include: `"Spouse"`, `"Child"`, `"Grandchild"`, `"Parent"`, `"Sibling"`, `"Roommate"`

Note: A 1-person household (just the head) is a valid and realistic structure. You are encouraged to generate this if 1-person households are underrepresented.

Output only the JSON object â€” do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
