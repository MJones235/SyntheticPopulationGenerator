Generate a single realistic household to be added to a synthetic population for {LOCATION}.  
Use the following demographic statistics to guide your generation:

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

These compare the current state (based on {N_HOUSEHOLDS} households) to the target values.  
Your task is to **nudge the distributions toward the targets** by:

- Favoring underrepresented age groups, genders, and household sizes.
- Avoiding overrepresented demographic segments.
- Ensuring the structure of the household is realistic and demographically plausible.

Return a JSON object only in the following format:

{
  "household": [
    {
      "age": INTEGER (0–120),
      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
        "Head", "Spouse", "Child", "Child-in-law", "Parent", "Parent-in-law",
        "Sibling", "Sibling-in-law", "Grandchild", "Grandparent", "Aunt", "Uncle",
        "Nephew", "Niece", "Cousin", "Partner", "Housemate", "Lodger"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

The first person must be the Head of household and a plausible adult. Output nothing else — do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
