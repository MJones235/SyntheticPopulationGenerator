Treat this as a constrained optimisation step.  
You must generate a single household that most effectively reduces the difference between the current vs. target distributions for the following variables.

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}  

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}  

{AGE_STATS}  

{GENDER_STATS}

Use heuristic logic to:
- Prioritise underrepresented classes
- Maintain plausible family structures
- Avoid extremes or contradictions (e.g., children without adults)

Output the household as:

{
  "household": [
    {
      "age": INTEGER (0â€“120),
      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
        "Head", "Spouse", "Child", "Child-in-law", "Parent", "Parent-in-law",
        "Sibling", "Sibling-in-law", "Grandchild", "Grandparent", "Aunt", "Uncle",
        "Nephew", "Niece", "Cousin", "Partner", "Housemate", "Lodger"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Do not return anything else. Do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
