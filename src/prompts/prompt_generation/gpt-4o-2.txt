Add one plausible household to a growing synthetic population for {LOCATION}.  
Current stats (based on {N_HOUSEHOLDS} out of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS}): 

{AGE_STATS}  

{GENDER_STATS}  

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}  

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

Choose underrepresented attributes. Avoid oversampling already dominant categories.  
Output a JSON object with a "household" array of people, each with:
- age (0–120)  
- gender ("Male" or "Female")  
- relationship_to_head (first person must be "Head")  

Return only the JSON — do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
