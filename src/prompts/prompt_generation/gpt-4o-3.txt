Please construct one new household for {LOCATION}, using the following procedure:

1. Examine the difference between current and target values in the following distributions:

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

2. Identify which household types and member characteristics are underrepresented.
3. Select a household structure that increases representation in those areas.
4. Populate the household with realistic individuals:
   - First member must be the Head (adult).
   - Assign plausible relationships (e.g., Spouse, Child, Lodger).
5. Maintain realism in age relationships (e.g., parents older than children).

Output only a JSON object with this structure — do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks:

{
  "household": [
    {
      "age": INTEGER (0–120),
      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
        "Head", "Spouse", "Child", "Child-in-law", "Parent", "Parent-in-law",
        "Sibling", "Sibling-in-law", "Grandchild", "Grandparent", "Aunt", "Uncle",
        "Nephew", "Niece", "Cousin", "Partner", "Housemate", "Lodger"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
