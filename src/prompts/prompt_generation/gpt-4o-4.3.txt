### Context  
Generate a new household for {LOCATION}.  
Current progress: {N_HOUSEHOLDS} of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} generated.

### Statistical Guidance  
Demographic targets vs. current values:  

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}  

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}  

{AGE_STATS}  

Focus on improving alignment with census distributions across all dimensions.  
In particular:
- Prioritise categories that are currently underrepresented.
- Avoid further increasing categories that are already overrepresented.
- Ensure household structures remain plausible and internally consistent.

### Output  
Return only a JSON object with one array field:

{
  "household": [
    {
      "age": INTEGER,
      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
        "Head", "Spouse", "Child", "Child-in-law", "Parent", "Parent-in-law",
