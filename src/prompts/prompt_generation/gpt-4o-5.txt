This household will be part of a synthetic population for {LOCATION}.  
{N_HOUSEHOLDS} out of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} have been generated.  
Use the following distribution statistics to guide your choices:

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

Select a household size and structure that are underrepresented. Avoid inflating segments already above target. Prioritise plausible combinations (e.g., parents with children, lodgers in shared households). Output only valid JSON — do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
