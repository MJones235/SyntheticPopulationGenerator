    { "age": 42, "gender": "Female", "relationship_to_head": "Head" },
    { "age": 15, "gender": "Male", "relationship_to_head": "Child" }
  ]

- {N_HOUSEHOLDS} of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} households generated
- Current vs. target stats: 

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}
