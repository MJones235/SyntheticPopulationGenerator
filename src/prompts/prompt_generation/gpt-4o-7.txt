Use the following logic to generate a household for {LOCATION}:

- IF young adults (18–30) are underrepresented → consider shared household or young couple.
- IF large households are below target → include multi-generational families or multiple children.
- IF female representation is low → increase number of females, but within realistic compositions.

Always:
- Begin with a plausible adult Head.
- Assign realistic relationships.
- Ensure consistency with household composition norms.

Stats:  

{AGE_STATS} 

{GENDER_STATS} 

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}  

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
