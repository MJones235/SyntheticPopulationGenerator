Add one household to a synthetic population for {LOCATION}, following these constraints:

- Only select household sizes that are currently underrepresented.

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}

- Prioritise selecting individuals from underrepresented age brackets.  
  Avoid adding individuals from overrepresented age brackets unless essential for plausibility.

{AGE_STATS}

- Balance genders per the following stats.

{GENDER_STATS}

- Use household composition stats to guide plausible relationship structures.  
  "Couple with non-dependent children" refers to a couple living with one or more adult children (typically aged 18+).  
  "Other" households include any structure beyond head, spouse/partner, and child. These may involve extended family (e.g. grandparents, siblings, grandchildren) or unrelated adults living together (e.g. university students or young professionals in shared houses).

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

Structure:
- A "household" array of at least one person.
- The first person must be "Head" and plausibly aged 18+.

Output only:

{
  "household": [
    {
      "age": INTEGER (0â€“120),
      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
