Add one household to a synthetic population for {LOCATION}, following these constraints:

- Only select household sizes that are currently underrepresented

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}

- Age brackets currently overrepresented in the synthetic population must be avoided unless required.

{AGE_STATS}

- Balance genders per the following stats; prefer underrepresented gender in ambiguous cases.

{GENDER_STATS}

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

Structure:
- A "household" array of at least one person.
- First person must be "Head" and plausibly aged 18+.

      "age": INTEGER (0â€“120),
      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
