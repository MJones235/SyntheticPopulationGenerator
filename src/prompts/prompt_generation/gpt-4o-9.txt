Let’s add one more household to our synthetic population for {LOCATION}.  
We’ve already created {N_HOUSEHOLDS} of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS}.

Based on our current gaps:

{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}

{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}

{AGE_STATS}

{GENDER_STATS}

Please:
- Choose underrepresented combinations of age, gender, and relationships.
- Avoid inflating overrepresented types.
- Keep households realistic (e.g., no 12-year-old Heads, no 30-year-old grandparents).

Your response must be a JSON object:

{
  "household": [
    {
      "age": INTEGER (0–120),
      "gender": "Male" or "Female",
      "relationship_to_head": one of [
        "Head", "Spouse", "Child", "Child-in-law", "Parent", "Parent-in-law",
        "Sibling", "Sibling-in-law", "Grandchild", "Grandparent", "Aunt", "Uncle",
        "Nephew", "Niece", "Cousin", "Partner", "Housemate", "Lodger"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

No preamble. No notes. Just JSON — do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
