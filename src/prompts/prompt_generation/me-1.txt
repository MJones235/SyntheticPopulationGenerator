You are generating a realistic synthetic population for Newcastle, UK.

The full population will consist of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} households. So far, {N_HOUSEHOLDS} have been generated. You will now generate one new household to add to this population.

Across the entire population, the distributions of household size, age, occupation and gender should reflect those reported in the 2021 UK Census. 

All major household types should be represented, including:
- Single-person
- Couples

- `"relationship_to_head"`: a string describing the person's relationship to the head of the household  
  - The first person listed is the head of the household and must have `"relationship_to_head": "Head"`.  The head should be an adult.  
  - Other valid values are: `"Partner"`, `"Child"`, `"Grandchild"`, `"Parent"`, `"Housemate"`, `"Other"`

Output only the JSON object â€” do not include markdown formatting, code fences, or backticks.
