You are generating a realistic synthetic population for {LOCATION}.

The full population will consist of {TOTAL_HOUSEHOLDS} households. So far, {N_HOUSEHOLDS} have been generated. You will now generate one new household to add to this population.

Use the following statistics to select individiuals that nudge the current distributions towards the targets.  

Begin by selecting the head of household.  This should be an adult belonging to an age group where the current value is lower than the target.  

Then select a realistic size and composition for the household that this head belongs to. Priotise sizes and compositions for which the current value is lower than the target.
1-person households contain a single adult of any age
2-person households can contain a couple, a lone parent or unrelated housemates
3+ person households can contain contain couples or lone parents with children, extended family or unrelated housemates.
Non-dependent children are aged 18+.
