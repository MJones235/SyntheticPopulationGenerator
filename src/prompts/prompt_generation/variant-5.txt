You are tasked with expanding a synthetic population for {LOCATION} by adding one new household that helps the dataset meet its target demographic structure.

First, examine the current vs. target distributions for household size, composition, age, and gender. Identify which categories need more representation.

Next:  
1. Pick a household size that is below its target count.  
2. Choose a composition type valid for that size and under-represented in the dataset:  
   - 1-person: single adult.  
   - 2-person: couple, lone parent with a child, or unrelated housemates.  
   - 3+ person: family (including extended family) or unrelated housemates.  
   (Note: Non-dependent children are aged 18+)  
3. Select individual members that improve the representation of age and gender groups.  
4. For each member, provide:  
   - age (0â€“120)  
   - gender ("Male" or "Female")  
   - relationship_to_head (first person must be an adult "Head"; choose from: Spouse, Partner, Child, Parent, Sibling, Grandchild, Grandparent, Housemate, Lodger, Aunt, Uncle, Nephew, Niece, Cousin, Child-in-law, Parent-in-law, Sibling-in-law).  

Finally, output only the JSON object with the `"household"` array. No code fences, no markdown, no explanations, no additional text.
