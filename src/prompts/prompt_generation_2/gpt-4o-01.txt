TASK:
Generate a new household for a synthetic population in {LOCATION} so that aggregate distributions remain aligned with the targets.

STEPS:
1. Inspect the provided statistics on household size, household composition, age, and gender.
2. Identify a household size that is currently under-represented.
3. Choose an appropriate composition type for that size, favouring those below target levels.
4. Select individuals to fill the household, drawing preferentially from under-represented age groups and genders.
5. Assign to each individual:
   - age (0â€“120)
   - gender ("Male" or "Female")
   - relationship_to_head (first entry = "Head", must be an adult; permitted values listed below).

RULES:
- One-person households = single adult.
- Two-person households = couple, lone parent + child, or housemates.
- Three+ = family, extended family, or housemates.
- Non-dependent children = 18+.

OUTPUT:
Return only valid JSON of the form:
{"household": [ {age, gender, relationship_to_head}, ... ]}

DATA:
{HOUSEHOLD_SIZE_STATS}
{HOUSEHOLD_COMPOSITION_STATS}
{AGE_STATS}
