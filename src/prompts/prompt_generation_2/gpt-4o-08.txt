TASK CONTEXT:
We are constructing a synthetic population for {LOCATION}. Your role is to generate one new household at a time until the dataset matches statistical distributions. You are currently tasked with producing a single household.

WORKFLOW:
1. Review the supplied distributions of household size, household composition, age, and gender.
2. Identify a shortfall in household size.
3. Select a suitable household composition from that size, prioritising those least represented.
4. Generate individuals, ensuring that under-represented ages and genders are chosen first.
5. Ensure the household conforms to logical rules:
   - Single-person households contain one adult.
   - Two-person households can be couple, lone parent+child, or housemates.
   - Three+ households can be family, extended family, or housemates.
   - All children aged 18+ are classified as non-dependent.
   - First person must be "Head" and aged 18+.
