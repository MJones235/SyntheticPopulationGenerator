# BASE PROMPT:
TASK:
You are an AI assistant generating a realistic synthetic population for {LOCATION}.
Your goal is to add one new household to a growing dataset, so that the generated population matches target distributions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the current and target distributions for household size, composition, age, and gender (provided below).
2. Select a household size category where the current count is below its target.
3. Choose a valid household composition for the selected size, prioritizing categories that are currently under-represented.
    - 1-person: contains a single adult of any age.
    - 2-person: can be either a couple, a lone parent with a child, or unrelated housemates.
    - 3+ person: can be a family (couples or lone parents with children, extended family), or unrelated housemates.
    - Non-dependent children are aged 18 or older.
4. Select individuals for the household, prioritizing under-represented age groups and genders.
5. For each person, include:
    - age (0â€“120)
    - gender ("Male" or "Female")
    - relationship_to_head (first must be "Head" and be an adult; valid values: "Spouse", "Partner", "Child", "Parent", "Sibling", "Grandchild", "Grandparent", "Housemate", "Lodger", "Aunt", "Uncle", "Nephew", "Niece", "Cousin", "Child-in-law", "Parent-in-law", "Sibling-in-law")
6. Output only a JSON object with a "household" array containing these individuals. Do not include markdown, formatting, or explanations.
